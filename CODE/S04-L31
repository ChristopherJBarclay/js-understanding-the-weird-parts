// OJBECT LITERALS
// in JS there are often more than one way to do something

var person = {};  // JS assumes this is object creation
// can also inititalize objects here.

var Tony = {
    firstname: 'Tony', 
    lastname: 'Alicea',
    address: {
        street: '111 Main St.',
        city: 'New York',
        state: 'NY'
        
    }
};
// ^ this is still treated as one line of code.
// this is the preferred way to create an object.

function greet(person) {
    console.log('Hi ' + person.firstname);
}

greet(Tony);

greet({ 
    firstname: 'Mary', 
    lastname: 'Doe' 
});
// can create an object on the fly like this. 

greet({ firstname: 'Chris', lastname: 'B' });
// one line version

Tony.address2 = {
    street: '333 Second St.'
};
// can mix and match these object literal creations with dot or bracket notation and add new properties and new objects as properties to an already existing object.
