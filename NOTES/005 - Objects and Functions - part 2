SECTIONS 4 - OBJECTS AND FUNCTIONS - part 2

    Section 4 is 5 hours of content (largest section of the class), so I have broken it down into multiple parts.


JSON and Object Literals
    JSON = JavaScript Ojbect Notation - inspired by object literal syntax in JS
    - Data used to be sent across the internet using XML format. But it wasted too much bandwidth doubling up on property names.
    - Now we use JSON to send data across the internet, which is like a subset of Object Literals.
    
    JSON objects are objects converted into strings
    - A JSON string is an Object Literal but not all Object Literals are JSON objects. 
    - All properties in JSON strings must be wrapped in quotes.
    
        - Can STRINGIFY javascript objects into JSON strings:
            console.log(JSON.stringify(objectLiteral));
        
        - Can parse a JSON string and convert it into a javascript object:
            var jsonValue = JSON.parse('{ "firstname": "Mary", "isAProgrammer": true }');
            
    - JSON is more strict than Object Literals. No functions as values for JSON strings.
    


FUNCTIONS AND OBJECTS
    This New Concept that will transform you from someone who uses Javascript to someone who deeply understands it
      and isn't scared of some of the weird or odd things that happen inside of it. Other programming languages cannot match this.
      
  FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS
    In JS, functions are objects.
    - Everything you can do with other types (objects, strings, numbers, booleans), you can do with Functions. 
    - You can assign variables to have a value that is a function. You can pass functions around as parameters to other functions.
    - You can create functions on the fly with a kind of literal syntax.
    This changes the way you can program. Completely different approaches to solving problems.
