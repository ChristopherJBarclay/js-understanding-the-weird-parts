Objects and the Dot
    Three types of properties / methods of an object... 
    - Primitive "property"
    - Object "property"
    - Function "method"
    These each sit in memory have a kind of address in your computer's memory. 
    
    Bracket Notation VS Dot Notation
        - Bracket Notation = Computed Member Access  (3rd highest precedence on the operator precedence list)
            - Requires quotes around the property of the object
        - Dot Notation = Member Access  (2nd highest precedence on the operator precedence list)
            - Don't need to put quotes around the property of the object. 
        These two work the same, but dot notation (member access) will act the same as computed member access
        
        - Preferred method is the Dot Operator instead of Bracket notation, it's much cleaner and easier to debut later on.


Objects and OBJECT LITERALS
    - Best way to create a new object is not with ' new Object(); '
    var person = {};  // this is an OBJECT LITERAL
    var person = { firstname: 'Tony', lastname: 'Alicea' }; 
    - Always inititalize objects like this. Faster and more efficient.
    - Also can write it on multiple lines and it is treated like one line of code until it hits the semicolon ;
